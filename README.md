# Alumni-Bridges

For my case study to earn my masters I built a management tool for Alumni Associations at colleges and university.

The problems I was trying to solve:  
* Providing an easy and modern way for users to manage Alumni. 
* Providing a system to keep track of donations
* Providing an interface for alumni to login, updated their own information and view other Alumni

## Other notes
The primary focus of the project was the database design & development.
Built with CodeIgnitor and heavily relies on stored procedures to do the heavy lifting.


## Todo 
* Redesign Interface
* Switching from PHP to Ruby
